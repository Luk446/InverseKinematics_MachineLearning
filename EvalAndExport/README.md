1.	Model Loading 
-	Eight pre-trained models are loaded from pickle files.
2.	Evaluation Function 
-	An evaluation function (eval) is defined to evaluate a model on the test data.
-	The function calculates three metrics: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
3.	Model Display/Eval 
-	All eight models are evaluated using the defined evaluation function.
-	The results (MAPE, MSE, MAE) for each model are printed in a tabular format.
4.	Model Inspection 
-	The architecture, optimizer configuration, and summary of a selected model (Model 2) are printed.
-	Summaries of all models are printed, showing the layer configurations and parameter counts.
